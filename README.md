# Otomi quick start

Otomi quick start is intended for users who want to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with [Otomi](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-core) on the most popular *public cloud providers*. 

We also support local installation of Otomi on *minikube*.  

**NOTE:**

Intended for experimentation/evaluation ONLY.

**You will be responsible for any/all infrastructure costs incurred by the used resources.**
This repository intends to minimize costs by only provisioning the minimum required resources for a given provider.
